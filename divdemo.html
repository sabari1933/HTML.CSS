                is getting its first makeover on the desktop in over a decade. The Wikimedia Foundation, 
                which runs the Wikipedia project, announced today the launch of an 
                updated interface aimed at making the site more accessible and easier to use with additions like improved search, 
                a more prominently located tool for switching between languages, 
                an updated header offering access to commonly used links, an updated table of contents section for 
                Wikipedia articles and other design changes for a better reading experience.</p>
